   MVC (Model–View–Controller): architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divides an application into three interconnected parts. User should be able to insert data into SQL database, and create a burger dynamically. After the burger is able to be eaten or regurgiated by updating its boolean value. It was also be deleted from the SQL database by pressing "Ya Termine!" by imorting orm object to our models, snd exporting the database functions to the controller which will perform aa CRUD operation on the specific id.
